00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ANDREW W. LO: So on behalf of the Sloan School I want to welcome all of you to 15.401 Finance Theory.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This course is meant for first year MBA students.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so that's the focus, and I'm going to assume that that's the background that all of you

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
will have. We may have a few other students in the class, but primarily it will be first year MBAs who

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
are thinking about a career in finance, as well as those of you who aren't

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
sure about a career in finance but are curious about it. Hopefully over the next 13 weeks we'll

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
be able to satisfy that curiosity. I want to start by talking a little bit

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
about what finance is, and how I got interested in it,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because I think it's often helpful in order to motivate a subject to get a sense of how

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
somebody else decided to choose this as a profession.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To do that I have to go back a little bit, and give you some background about

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
my own educational experiences. So let me start by mentioning that I've

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
been at MIT for the past 20 years, and been in the finance group all that time.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Before that I taught at the Wharton School for four years. And before that, I got my PhD in economics

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
from Harvard University, and then graduated in 1980 from Yale also majoring in economics.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And during that time I've learned an enormous amount both about finance and the real world,

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but one of the things that I keep coming back to is the fact that the finance field

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
is almost unique in how it applies to practical management

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
problems. And what I want to try to do over the next 13 weeks is to convince you of the fact that finance

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is in fact, the most important subject that you'll ever encounter. That in fact, finance is at the core of everything

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that you will ever do in business and in management. Now that's a tall order I recognize,

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and I suspect that some of you are quite skeptical about the role that finance might play in your own career objectives.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I know many of you have very different career objectives. And I'm not even trying to convince all of you

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to go into a career in finance, but I am trying to convince all of you that finance is really

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the lifeblood and the basic lingua franca of all of business.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And that's one of the reasons why finance is such an important subject. Now before I begin, let me ask you a question.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How many people have had no finance background whatsoever?

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, that's great. I look forward to a challenge.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the other reason it's great is I have to tell you that it's a real privilege for me to be here in front of you to tell you about finance

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
for the very first time. And it reminds me a little bit of my younger son who is an extraordinarily fussy eater,

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
he's eight years old now. But ever since he was born he had some allergies, and he just refused to eat most of everything.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In fact, my wife often says that my younger son is a vegetarian except he doesn't eat vegetables.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So he's an incredibly fussy eater, and somehow when he was one year old he saw my older son eating an ice cream cone,

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and figured that that's something he ought to try. How he figured that out, I don't know. But he tasted it for the very first time,

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and you could see his face change in about four seconds from disgust to curiosity to absolute, you know,

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
enthrallment with the taste and feel of ice cream. He just loved it thereafter. That's one of his major food groups now.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's ice cream. And so I feel privileged to be able to share that experience

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
here in the sense that once you get a taste of finance, I think you're going to be incredibly excited and enthralled by the subject.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because it's one of the few subjects, in fact, that's the only subject that I've encountered that is both rigorous, it's extraordinarily

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
challenging from a research and intellectual perspective, and at the end of the day it's extremely practical.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
In fact, I would say it's indispensable for financial management. So I'm going to try to convince you of that over the next 13

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
weeks, and I'm going to do that by going over material that you will find indispensable.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As many of you know, at the end of the course we have a ritual where we hand out teaching ratings. And among the finance faculty, among all the faculty,

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
we're very concerned about good teaching. So these teaching ratings actually matter.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I've always thought that having a teaching rating survey at the end of the semester,

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is somewhat misguided. What I'd like to do, and what I've proposed hasn't been adopted yet, I propose

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to have teaching ratings submitted five years after a course is done. Now this may be a problem for some people who aren't

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
up to speed in the classroom. But the reason I say this is, because it will only be after you get into your jobs, into your careers,

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
before you realize how useful finance is. And five years from now, I suspect all of you

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
will come back and say, gee, this is one of the most important courses you have ever taken. Not because of me, but because of the substance of what

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks. It's because of you and all of the work that you will put into this course.

56
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This will be the most challenging course you will ever love. So I-- stealing from the military--

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think that you'll really appreciate how the discipline of financial logic

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
will help you to think smarter about all of your management decisions no matter what you decide to do with your careers.

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now that's a very tall order. I've built up expectations. So I'm going to have to deliver over the next 13 weeks,

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and we'll see whether or not we can do that. But let me start now by talking about what

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we're going to cover today. I want to start with a little bit of motivation, and then talk about the dramatis personae.

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
These are the cast of characters that we're going to be focusing on over the next 13 weeks.

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then I'm going to lay out the fundamental challenges of financial analysis. It turns out there are only two.

64
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There are only two challenges in financial analysis, and once you figure both of those out, you're done.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So if by chance you can figure that out before the end of the class, you don't need to come back for the rest of the lectures.

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then I'm going to turn to providing you with a framework for thinking about these financial

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
challenges. To me it's very important to have a framework to start with, because I like to organize my thoughts

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
into things that I know and things that I don't know. And of the things that I know, how did it relate to the stuff that I already knew, or thought I knew.

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I want to give you a sense of that kind of framework to think about financial analysis upfront.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You probably won't fully appreciate it at this point, but sometime over the next 13 weeks you will get it.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And so I want to give that to you so that you can start thinking about it subconsciously, unconsciously, and then eventually you

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
will understand how all the pieces fit together. I then want to talk about the importance

73
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
of two aspects of financial analysis that make finance different from every other discipline you

74
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
will ever encounter here at MIT and elsewhere. And that is time and risk.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Without those two factors it turns out that finance is actually done.

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In other words, there's no real research challenges, no open questions left once you eliminate time and risk.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Put in another way, the only reason that there exists a finance department, and finance

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
faculty, and finance journals, and a finance industry, the only reason is because of time and risk.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I'm going to come back to that. Then I'm going to conclude by giving you the six

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
basic principles of finance. These are principles that you will encounter in all of your finance courses for the rest of your stay

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
at MIT and elsewhere. These are the ideas, the fundamental ideas, that have shaped financial markets

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and that are at the root cause of all of the financial market innovations, as well as all of the financial market crises

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
that we've seen including what's been going on over the last several months in the subprime mortgage market. In fact, we're going to talk about the subprime mortgage

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
problems after we cover fixed income securities. Right now I suspect most of you know that there's something going on, know that it's bad stuff,

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but you don't know why, how, where, when, and what to do about it. Well, in about five lectures, you will.

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not complicated, but it's different from anything that you've ever encountered. And in fact, financial analysis, I suspect,

87
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is different from anything most of you have ever encountered. I'm hoping that by the end of the course,

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
it will change the way you think about everything. And again, I recognize that that's a tall order,

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but you tell me 13 weeks from now whether or not I've delivered. And then I'll conclude by talking about the course

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
overview, and then finally I want to say a few words about how as a student you can get the most out of this course.

91
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is a part of the lecture that I've always felt is critical at the very start of a course

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
like this, because there are a number of challenges that you will face over the next 13

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
weeks regarding this material. And I've always thought that it would be helpful for the instructor to let me know where

94
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
those challenges might come from, and what I should do in advance to prepare for those challenges. So I'm going to do that at the end of this hour and a half.

95
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For next time I'd like you to read Brealey and Myers, chapters one and two. We are going to be covering that today as well as next Monday.

96
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So please keep up with your readings. And at the end of this lecture, I will talk a bit about the course requirements

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and other aspects of the course mechanics. Any questions?

98
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right, let me start with some motivation about why you might want to study finance

99
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and why finance is so important. And I've always found that with motivation it's really best

100
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to do it in a personal way. That is, to try to find an individual or a group

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
of individuals that personify a particular discipline or endeavor.

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so there are three people that I'd like to introduce you to. I suspect you'll know at least two out of the three,

103
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but my guess is you won't know all of them. The first person-- oh, before I do that, I want to introduce a very simple definition of what

104
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
finance is. So this is the very first equation that you'll ever see in this course, and there'll be many others of course.

105
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But the first expression of exactly what is finance is this, finance is simply equal to mathematics plus money.

106
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now that suggests that mathematics as a discipline is equal to finance without the money, but really that's not my point.

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Although it's true by the way, that's not my point. My point is that finance is the study,

108
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the systematic and disciplined study of financial transactions of money.

109
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Now when you see this you might think, well, gee, I don't really have a strong math background. Maybe I'm in the wrong place or the wrong class.

110
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I want to explain to you that that's completely inaccurate, and inappropriate.

111
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When I say mathematics, I'm actually talking about a very wide range of mathematics.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Everything from the extraordinarily complex and profound to the extremely pedestrian

113
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and obvious. So literally the range from differential geometry

114
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and partial differential equations on one end of the spectrum to arithmetic and high school

115
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
algebra at the other end of the spectrum. Now since this is an introductory finance class,

116
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I assume that you know nothing. What I mean by that is, I assume that there are no prerequisites that you have other than what it took

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
for you to get into here, which is pretty substantial by the way. Congratulations to all of you for getting in.

118
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But we're not requiring that you have any background in quantitative analysis, computers,

119
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
upper level mathematics. So when I say finance is equal to mathematics plus money,

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
there's a variety of kinds of mathematics that can be appropriate for creating an extraordinarily profitable career in this industry.

121
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And now here are the three examples. Anybody know who James Simons is?

122
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Who is he? AUDIENCE: Well, I know about Renaissance. ANDREW W. LO: You know about Renaissance Technologies.

123
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you know what James Simons did before he started Renaissance Technologies? Yeah.

124
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
AUDIENCE: He's a math professor. ANDREW W. LO: He's a math professor, that's right. James Simons is a math professor.

125
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, was a math professor. In fact, he was quite a well-known math professor. When I first heard of him, it wasn't

126
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
because of Renaissance Technologies, which is a hedge fund that he started about 15 or 20 years ago.

127
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
James Simons was a differential geometer who for many years was the chairman of the math department

128
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
at Stony Brook in New York. And he authored with S.S. Chern a particular field of study

129
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
in differential geometry called Chern-Simons theory, which has subsequently proved to be extraordinarily

130
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
useful in an area of physics known as string theory. Extraordinarily abstract.

131
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And Simon started a hedge fund about 20 years ago.

132
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And this is probably the single most successful hedge fund in the history of the industry in terms of its performance

133
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
record. Over the course of 15 or 20 years,

134
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
he's put together a track record that has literally beaten every other hedge fund manager's track

135
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
record by a lot. So it's not just a little bit. He's just sort of way out there. He's the Michael Phelps of quantitative investment

136
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
strategies. By the way, just to give you a sense of how successful he has been.

137
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In 2006, two years ago, it was reported by Institutional Investor's Alpha Magazine--

138
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
this is a trade publication for the hedge fund industry-- it was reported that James Simons was the single most highly

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:35,000
paid hedge fund manager that year with a take-home pay of $1.7 billion.

140
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Now, that's not wealth, that's income. That was on his W-2.

141
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That was one year's compensation. And he did it-- he did this by building a quantitative investment

142
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
management company with 75 PhDs in mathematics, physics, computer science, and so on.

143
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And nobody, nobody knows what he does or how he does it. It's extraordinarily secret.

144
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But there's no doubt that he's incredibly successful. So that's one end of the spectrum.

145
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That kind of mathematics can make money, and can be extraordinarily relevant financial analysis.

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now at the other end of the spectrum, we have this guy.

147
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You may have heard of him, Warren Buffett. He is currently the richest man on earth.

148
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In 2008 Forbes ranked him number one in terms of wealth. At the time, February of 2008, he was worth $62 billion.

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In fact, in a private conversation I was told that when Simons found out he said, really?

150
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
$62 billion? How did he get that? It's amazing. That's an extraordinary amount of wealth for an individual

151
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to put together. And what's extraordinary about it, is how he did it. As many of you know Warren Buffett is an investor based

152
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
in Omaha, Nebraska. His office is probably smaller than many of the conference

153
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
rooms here at Sloan. The number of people he has working for him, I suspect, is fewer than many of you who have

154
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
done your startups or plan to. He's got an extraordinarily small staff.

155
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mainly it's Charlie Munger and him, and a couple of secretaries, and maybe a few accountants here and there, and lawyers of course.

156
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But what he does is to read company prospectuses, income

157
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
statements, balance sheets. And with literally high school arithmetic

158
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
he's built this incredible investment empire by looking at valuation.

159
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Simple accounting. Now I say simple accounting, but there's nothing simple about what he does.

160
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And so clearly he has certain skills that also involve mathematics, but not

161
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the kind of mathematics that James Simons uses. And finally, the third individual

162
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that I'd like to introduce you to is this fellow, Jack Welch. Now again, many of you know him or know of him.

163
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know that he actually teaches a course here at Sloan. But you may not know that his PhD was actually

164
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
in engineering. And he started out at General Electric in 1960.

165
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Became CEO in 1981, and at that time the revenues

166
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
of General Electric was about $26 billion a year. So it was already a big and successful company.

167
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And Jack Welch took it over in 1981. At the time there were 400,000 employees for General Electric.

168
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Five years later, there were 300,000 employees at General Electric. He eliminated 100,000 jobs.

169
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's one of the reasons why he developed the nickname Neutron Jack, because like a neutron bomb,

170
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
he eliminated a huge segment of the population. But five years later with 300,000 employees,

171
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
he increased the market value of General Electric by several fold. And at the end of his tenure in 2001, 20 years later,

172
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
General Electric's revenues was not $26 billion, it was $130 billion.

173
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He increased it by a factor of 4 and 1/2 over the course of 20 years.

174
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's an extraordinary accomplishment for an individual. Now why do I put him up here?

175
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's because one of the things that Welch did at General Electric, one of the things that he was extraordinarily good at, was making

176
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
good decisions about investments, making good decisions about costs, being able to understand

177
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the language of finance despite the fact that he used none of his PhD skills in his job.

178
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He was an engineer by training, not a manager. He didn't go to management school,

179
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
although he did a lot of executive education after his PhD.

180
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The reason that I give you these three cast of characters is because they are so different in what they do.

181
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They have such different backgrounds. They're all extraordinarily successful,

182
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but there's one thing in common. The thing in common is that they all understand innately,

183
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
deeply, fundamentally, the language of finance. And what we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks,

184
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
are the very basics. Things that they take for granted. Things that they use on a daily basis to do their jobs.

185
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So it's not to say that if you do well in this course you'll end up being one of these guys,

186
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but it's certainly a prerequisite I would say. There's nobody that's been successful in business,

187
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
truly successful, without having an understanding, at least an innate or instinctive understanding,

188
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
of the concepts that we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks. So to me, that's exciting.

189
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Now again, I'm not trying to motivate you by greed. I'd rather motivate you by the intellectual challenge

190
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
of finance, and there will be some extraordinarily challenging ideas. Ideas that are not natural for any of you at this point,

191
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but which I hope will be very natural at the end of this 13 weeks.

192
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So let me start with the cast of characters that we're going to be studying over the next 13 weeks.

193
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
There are going to be four components of the economy that we're going to focus on. Now this is a flow diagram of the economy.

194
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Since we're at MIT we have to have flow diagrams at some point, right? So here's my version of a flow diagram.

195
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This is a flow model of the economy, and there are four components that comprise the financial system.

196
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Households, financial intermediaries, non-financial corporations, and then capital markets.

197
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Now obviously the economy is comprised of additional components like labor markets and product

198
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
markets. We're not going to focus on that. Although there are certain financial aspects of those markets.

199
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Given that we only have 13 weeks, our attention will be spent on those four components,

200
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and I'm going to cover each of those four components, both in parallel and to a certain degree sequentially,

201
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
all right? So I want you to be familiar with these four, because we're going to be talking about them interchangeably at various points in time.

202
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Financial analysis applies to all of these components in exactly the same way.

203
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But once you apply them to the specific context, the terminology may change, the particular applications

204
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
may look different. What I'm going to try to teach you in this 13 weeks is the underpinning theories that

205
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
unify all of the various different kinds of ideas. So these are the four components that we're

206
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
going to be looking at from now and then. Now let me talk about the fundamental challenges

207
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
of finance. I told you that there are only two, right? And here they are.

208
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There are two aspects of financial analysis that we're going to be focused on. The first is the valuation of assets.

209
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And the second is very simply the management of assets.

210
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's it. That's all there is to it. Valuing and managing.

211
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I can tell you exactly what the managing part is going to look like. Managing is going to involve figuring out which of two

212
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
possibilities is more valuable. And then you know what? You take the more valuable option.

213
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's it. That's all there is to it. Figuring out the value, that's going to be challenging.

214
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So we're going to take that first challenge to start with, and try to understand valuation.

215
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm going to argue that all business decisions, any kind of business decision, involves those two challenges.

216
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Valuing something, and then once you value it, make a decision on what you want to do with that value.

217
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is why I've argued that finance is the most important subject, because literally any business decision that you will ever engage in,

218
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
constitutes those two components. Valuation and management.

219
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Now valuation is going to be a challenge by itself, because it's not at all clear what value we're talking about.

220
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In other words, what is value? Is water valuable?

221
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, life can't be sustained without it. At least carbon based forms of life. So water is pretty valuable.

222
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But water is not that expensive. At least before Poland Springs came along.

223
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now what about diamonds? As far as I know, humans do not need diamonds to survive, and yet diamonds are extraordinarily expensive.

224
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
There are certain gems that are invaluable. Now how can that be?

225
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Clearly we have to think more carefully about what we mean by value.

226
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And of course, once value is established then management is relatively easy to do.

227
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Objectives plus valuations obviously leads to decisions. So once you tell me what you're trying to achieve,

228
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and then you value all the various different possibilities, then I can tell you what the right decision is.

229
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Pick the decision that is the most valuable for achieving the objectives that you want.

230
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Now that doesn't really help a lot if we can't apply this to specific contexts,

231
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and come up with specific value. So I want to hammer this home, and to do

232
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that I want to talk about how it is that financial markets helps us establish value through the price discovery mechanism.

233
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And to do that, I am going to do a simple demonstration. Now when I was growing up I went to one

234
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
of these specialized high schools that focused on science. So we were always getting these various different kinds

235
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
of neat demonstrations of the Tesla kind of coil. I've always been very jealous of these science teachers,

236
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
because they have these cool demonstrations that we in finance don't. So I've developed a little demonstration of my own.

237
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's a simple one that has to do with the price discovery mechanism, and because I teach two sections, I'm going to have to make it a little bit more

238
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
involved than normally. So I need two volunteers. The first volunteer-- thank you. I'd like you to take these two pieces of paper,

239
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
these are blank pieces of paper. On one of them write heads, and the other write tails. And then place them face down, and shuffle them

240
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
so you don't know which is which. And I need another volunteer who has a coin that they can flip,

241
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
because-- thank you. So as soon as he's done, I'm going to ask you to flip a coin. Do you have a coin by the way?

242
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
AUDIENCE: Yeah. ANDREW W. LO: OK. I have two items here. One of which is going to be auctioned off in this section,

243
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and the other is going to be auctioned off in the later section. And since I don't know what your preferences are for one or the other, I want to randomize this

244
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so that there's no chance that I favor one section or the other. So are you done with that?

245
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You shuffled them. You don't know which is which. OK, I'd like you to take these two face down, and put one in front of one of these packages,

246
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and the other in front of the other face down as well. While you do that, can you go ahead and flip your coin?

247
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And as soon as he puts that on there, I want you to tell me whether you flipped heads or tails. And based upon that, the particular object

248
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
that is chosen will be auctioned off in this particular section. OK, go ahead.

249
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What have you got? AUDIENCE: Tails. ANDREW W. LO: Tails, OK. So tails. This is heads, and this is tails.

250
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So here is the item that I'm going to auction off. Before I do that, I'm going to ask somebody. Anybody know what's in here?

251
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Nobody knows what's in that box? Well, what do you think its value is?

252
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Zero?

253
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Negative? Can't be negative, right? There's limited liabilities.

254
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You can't owe me for something that's in there. So good. We've established some information.

255
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
There's a zero lower bound. Well, I don't know what the value is.

256
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to figure it out. Rather, you're going to figure it out.

257
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm going to auction this off, and now this is for real. So don't bid if you can't pay me, and by the way,

258
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I expect to be paid in cash. All right? So I'm serious.

259
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
This is a serious game. So if you don't want to participate, you're not prepared to pay me in cash at the end of this lecture, do not bid.

260
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
All right? OK, I'm going to open it up. Anybody want to start bidding for this item?

261
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
AUDIENCE: $1. ANDREW W. LO: $1. AUDIENCE: Three. ANDREW W. LO: $3. AUDIENCE: $4.

262
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
AUDIENCE: Four. AUDIENCE: Six. ANDREW W. LO: Six. AUDIENCE: Five. ANDREW W. LO: All right, $6 is the high bid.

263
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Can't do that. All right, $6 is the high bid. AUDIENCE: Ten.

264
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
AUDIENCE: Ten. ANDREW W. LO: Ten. OK, we got two tens here. You were the first. So that's your bid. Your bid is the high bid. $10.

265
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
AUDIENCE: 20. ANDREW W. LO: 20. We have 20. Wow! AUDIENCE: High roller. ANDREW W. LO: $20.

266
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You do see that this package is smaller than this one, right? It's a tiny little thing. $20.

267
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
AUDIENCE: 30. ANDREW W. LO: $30. $30.

268
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
High bid. Any more than $30? AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question, please?

269
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
ANDREW W. LO: Yes. AUDIENCE: Where does the money-- who gets it? ANDREW W. LO: I get the money. That's a great question.

270
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's a great question. This is going to go to the foundation to support Andrew Lo.

271
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm the charity. So this is not a charity auction. This is going to go to me. By the way, I paid for these items.

272
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So that's why it's going to go to reimburse my teaching costs. AUDIENCE: It's going to ice cream, [INAUDIBLE]

273
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
ANDREW W. LO: Right. OK, $30 high bid. Any higher bid than that?

274
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
$30? Nothing higher? AUDIENCE: 31. ANDREW W. LO: 31.

275
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
AUDIENCE: 35. ANDREW W. LO: 35. OK, do I hear 40?

276
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Anybody want to do 40? $40?

277
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
AUDIENCE: I'll give you 40. ANDREW W. LO: $40. All right, we've got $40.

278
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Anybody willing to go 45? $45?

279
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
All right. AUDIENCE: 45. ANDREW W. LO: $45. Wow! OK.

280
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Do we hear 50? $50?

281
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
45 is the high bid. Anybody for 50? AUDIENCE: Can I short too? ANDREW W. LO: No shorting, sorry.

282
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm the only auctioneer here. $45 is the high bid. Anybody here 50?

283
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Going once. Going twice. All right, sold. $45.

284
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Now you're going to pay me, right? AUDIENCE: Yep. ANDREW W. LO: All right. We established the value.

285
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's $45. That's the market at work.

286
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
None of you knew what was in here. It could be nothing actually.

287
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But I suspect that you didn't think it was nothing,

288
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
because you bid for it, right? Moreover, I didn't let you touch it. I didn't let you feel it.

289
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I didn't let you shake it. There was no information whatsoever other this very pretty packaging. And yet somehow magically you were

290
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
able to come up with a value. Now we could argue whether that value is good or bad.

291
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But it's a number, and it's a number that can now be used for analysis.

292
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Now again, I'm not commenting on how good or bad the number is. In a minute we're going to find out, because I'm going to open this.

293
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Or let this gentleman here open it, and see what he bought. But before he does that, I want to comment that knowing nothing

294
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
without any information whatsoever, we've established value.

295
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
That's remarkable. Now it's not true, though, that there is no information. In fact, there's a tremendous amount

296
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
of information in this room. Tremendous amount. Because you know a number of things.

297
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know about the size of packages. You know about the fact that I'm a professor, and if I really cheat you then I might get in trouble

298
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
with the dean. There are a number of constraints that are in place,

299
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and with this audience those constraints affected the value.

300
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
For the next five weeks that's what we're going to be doing, is talking about valuation and trying

301
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
to understand how what just happened happened.

302
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
OK, would you like to open it up, and let us know what you've got for your $45? And you'll let me know whether this

303
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
has been a good deal or a bad deal for you and for me.

304
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, just rip it. My wife does this all the time.

305
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It drives me crazy. My sons are just-- AUDIENCE: I'm enjoying my [INAUDIBLE] $45.

306
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:51,000
ANDREW W. LO: Fair point. Fair point.

307
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
AUDIENCE: Oohhh! [APPLAUSE]

308
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
ANDREW W. LO: Anybody know what the retail value of that is? It's an iPod Nano 4 gig version.

309
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
AUDIENCE: 125. ANDREW W. LO: 149 to be precise. So you had a good deal.

310
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. ANDREW W. LO: You're welcome. Thank you, because what we did was

311
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
to engage in a price discovery process with limited information. With limited information.

312
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I couldn't get the value out of that that I wanted to. I would have loved to have gotten a bid of $149,

313
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
but would any of you be willing to pay that for a box with no information at all?

314
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Probably not. So the lack of transparency, the lack of information, actually reduced the value of that object.

315
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But nevertheless, it did have a value. Because some of you were willing to take a chance that there might be something interesting in that package.

316
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That is what we're going to try to understand over the next 13 weeks, and for the first five of those weeks

317
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
we're going to try to take it apart. We're going to try to understand how it is that the market comes

318
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
up with the value. And it's going to be a challenge.

319
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This is hard to do, because just like if we decided to spend the rest of the lecture figuring out

320
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
how you came up with a $45 bid, or why you weren't willing to go to 50.

321
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's going to be really hard for us to tease out all of the thinking that went into this kind of discussion.

322
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So that's why we have work to do. It will be exciting work, because at the end we are going to come up with specific quantitative analysis

323
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that will tell us how valuation is done. So that's where we're going to focus on

324
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
for the next few weeks. Clearly once we figure out valuation,

325
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
we can then focus on management. And the first two-thirds of this class will be focused on valuation.

326
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The last one third will be focused on taking those ideas, and applying them to management contexts like capital budgeting

327
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and risk management. For valuation, the kind of questions

328
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,000
that we're going to tackle are ones that implicitly we did in just a few minutes here. It's going to be how are financial assets valued

329
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
versus how should they be valued, and is that always the same?

330
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Is it the case that financial assets are valued the way they should be valued, and what do we even mean by whether or not it should

331
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
be valued in a way or not. And finally, we're going to ask the question for valuation,

332
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
how well do financial markets really work? Can we always rely on them to work well?

333
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In this case, I don't know if you would call this particular auction one that worked out well.

334
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Certainly worked out well for you, but it didn't work out well for me. So in what sense did it work out well?

335
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well, it worked out well in the sense that if I really wanted to get rid of that box, if I really wanted to unload it, I actually was able to do that.

336
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And I got something for it. Sight unseen, with no information whatsoever, I actually got $45.

337
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Roughly a third of the value of the asset. That's actually not too bad. If you're trying to sell an asset sight unseen,

338
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and you need to do it immediately, a 66% discount is actually pretty fair.

339
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Now we're going to see more examples of that over the next few weeks. Once we determine value, then the question is management.

340
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How much should I save or spend? That's a management question that all of you have to deal with at some point or another in your lives.

341
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What should I buy? What should I sell? When should I buy and sell it, and how should I finance the transaction?

342
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Those are the problems of financial analysis plain and simple. These are problems that apply to Jack Welch, to James Simons,

343
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
to Warren Buffett, and to you. And it applies to you not just from the corporate perspective,

344
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
but from a personal perspective as well. Every one of you have to think about these issues on a daily basis.

345
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And so finance really is completely inclusive in the sense that it applies to virtually everything

346
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that you will ever encounter in life. To do that I have to go over the framework

347
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
of financial analysis, and the starting point is accounting.

348
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Accounting is the language, the lexicon of finance

349
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,000
in that it's the beginning of how to measure economic concepts. Like profit and loss, revenues and costs, and so on.

350
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So while many of you may not have accounting backgrounds, you will learn a fair bit of accounting in this course,

351
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
just because you're going to have to in order to understand the material in the lectures.

352
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So you'll need to get familiar with the basic terms of accounting, and in particular you're going to have to focus on two concepts that are probably

353
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
alien to you. The notion of a stock and a flow. Now when I say stock, I don't mean common stock or equities,

354
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I have a different term in mind. By stock in this context, I mean the stock of assets.

355
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The level of assets. And by flow I mean the rate of change of assets.

356
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You know when I was in grad school, we started discussing this concept on the first day of macroeconomics, and then one of the students

357
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
in the back of the room said, excuse me, Professor, but isn't that just the distinction between a variable

358
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and its first derivative? And the professor was a little bit taken aback and said,

359
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
well, yes, that's right. But let me give you another way of thinking about it that is somewhat more intuitive. And that is, think about a bathtub,

360
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and think about the faucet turned on and the water flowing into it. The stock is the level of the water.

361
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The flow is how fast the water is coming into the tub.

362
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And so after that explanation the student still seemed confused, and so the professor said,

363
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
you know what, some people find bathtubs intuitive, other people find derivatives intuitive. So to each his own.

364
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
These two concepts are extraordinarily critical to financial analysis. And accounting counterparts are nothing more than the balance

365
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
sheet and the income statement. The balance sheet measures the stock of wealth of a company.

366
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What your assets are, and what your claims on those assets or liabilities are.

367
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,000
On the other hand, the flow of wealth into a company or out of a company is measured by the income statement.

368
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This tells you how much the company is making per unit time versus its losses.

369
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So the framework for financial analysis that we're going to be coming back to time and again is this framework of a corporation.

370
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A corporation has a certain set of assets. It's got claims on those assets, which are called liabilities.

371
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So this picture, this snapshot, measures the level of the bathtub. But that's not enough to understand

372
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
how a company is doing. You also have to look at the income statement, which

373
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
tells you the sources of funds, and the uses of funds over any time period.

374
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Typically on a quarterly basis. So we're going to come back to this concept as the framework

375
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
for financial analysis. And by the way, this is the sum total of the tools

376
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that Warren Buffett uses for analyzing his investments. That's it.

377
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Believe it or not. Nothing fancier. So it's an incredibly powerful set of ideas

378
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
if you know how to read it.

379
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That framework when you think about it from a corporate financial decision perspective,

380
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
involves making decisions at five points in time.

381
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Corporate financial decisions involve thinking about how to deal with cash raised from investors.

382
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,000
How to think about cash invested in real assets, and how to deal with cash generated by operations.

383
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
How much cash to reinvest, and how much cash you give back to your investors.

384
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So from this you should get the idea that as a corporate financial officer

385
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,000
you are focused on cash, the flow of cash. In fact, cash you can think of as the lifeblood of a company.

386
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
If you follow the cash, you will eventually hit upon every important aspect of the modern corporation's

387
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
operations. And as a financial officer, you will be responsible for analyzing that flow.

388
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And as a decision maker, as a leader of a corporation, you're going to have to make decisions about that cash flow.

389
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Jack Welch uses the information to be able to make those decisions. But he doesn't just get those decisions prepackaged for him,

390
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
he has to understand what those numbers mean. Just like Warren Buffett. Now the corporate financial decisions involved,

391
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,000
obviously, have a variety of different components from a perspective of career paths.

392
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
From the management perspective real investment decisions involve two and three.

393
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So if you're thinking about investing in a new division or a new plant or getting involved in a new product area, you've

394
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
got to focus on two and three. On the other hand, if you're the chief financial officer, and you're thinking about how should the company finance

395
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
its operations, you're going to be focused on one and four. If you're the board of directors,

396
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and you're deciding how much to pay out to the shareholders, you're going to be thinking about five.

397
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And if you're engaged in managing the risks of the corporation, you're going to be worried about one and five.

398
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And ultimately your objective as a shareholder and as a manager of this corporation

399
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is to do well by the owners. So your objective is to maximize shareholder wealth,

400
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and the framework that I've introduced is going to allow you to do that. Now again, this may seem kind of theoretical to you,

401
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and I realize that. So I'm going to ask you to make this more personal. And to do that, I'm going to ask you to turn this

402
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
into your own personal household financial decision making framework. So I'd like you to take all of these ideas

403
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and literally apply them to yourself. Think about the cash flows that are

404
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
flowing through your own life. There may not be that much right now since you're at school,

405
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
but believe me, it will grow. So the household, this is you, sits in

406
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
between real economic activities. In other words, your job, and financial assets

407
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and liabilities, which are all of the financial transactions that you deal with.

408
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So this cash flow process that I outlined for corporations, it

409
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
works for you too. So there's cash raised from financial institutions, right?

410
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like student loans or borrowing or home equity loans.

411
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's cash invested in real assets. What's the biggest real asset that you are all

412
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,000
investing in right now? AUDIENCE: Education [INAUDIBLE]. ANDREW W. LO: Exactly. Human capital, yourselves. Your own education.

413
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Cash generated by labor supply. Well, obviously, when you get a job you're going to be generating cash.

414
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Cash consumed and reinvested in real assets. So consumed means beer or pretzels or whatever,

415
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and investing in real assets means you invested either in yourself or you invest it

416
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
in a home or your children. Those are real assets. Sometimes they're also real liabilities,

417
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
but that's a separate issue. And finally cash invested in financial assets.

418
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Most of you may not have a lot of financial assets at this point, but you actually have some. I suspect 401(k) plans, retirement, Social Security.

419
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Those are financial assets that whether you know it or not, you're invested in. And so when you think about management,

420
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
think about personal management. How are you managing yourself? You've got to think about real investment.

421
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Consumption and financing, savings and investment, risk management, and, obviously, what is

422
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
your overall objective in life? And what you ought to be doing is with that objective in mind,

423
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,000
managing your real and financial assets to maximize the likelihood of achieving those objectives.

424
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So what I'm asking you to do is, I want you to take this course personally. I want you to take the ideas.

425
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Every single idea that I mention, and whether I tell you to or not for the next 13 weeks,

426
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I want you to take that idea and ask the question, how does that make my life better off? How can I use that in my own personal management activities

427
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
to improve the kind of decisions that I'm making? Because if you could do that, if you learn how to do that instinctively,

428
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
you will then take those ideas and apply them to management contexts in your career. And it will make it much more likely

429
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
that you'll get more out of this course than you otherwise might. Now there are two other factors that I describe

430
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that make financial analysis challenging, and those two factors are time and risk.

431
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I've argued before that without these two elements finance is complete. There is no more research to be done.

432
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:55,000
There's no more analysis to be done, and all of you probably will already be able to intuit a lot of the decisions

433
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
that you're going to be forced to make. Because without time-- and by time I mean decisions

434
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:10,000
at different points in time-- without time and without risk financial decisions

435
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
actually reduce to basic micro economic analysis. If you've taken an undergraduate course in microeconomics

436
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
supply equal demand, well, you've learned all there is to learn about finance without time and risk.

437
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The only reason that finance is interesting, the only challenging aspects of what we do

438
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
are because of time and risk. The fact that cash flows now are not the same as cash

439
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
flows later, and that time flows in only one direction.

440
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
In about four lectures, I'm going to give you an alternative proof of the theory of special relativity.

441
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And this proof will have to do with the fact that interest rates are not negative.

442
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It turns out that there's a very deep philosophical connection between finance and physics that we're going to get to.

443
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But this is something that you don't need to be a physicist to understand. In fact, I'd argue that Warren Buffett,

444
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
although he may not be able to articulate these principles, these are principles that are somehow

445
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
inbred in his worldview. He knows that $1 today is not the same as $1 next year.

446
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And he also knows that $1 today without risk is not the same as $1 today with a little bit of risk.

447
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Even a tiny little bit of risk, he knows that. And at the end of this course, you will too.

448
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So risk we have to talk about in a much more serious way. We're not going to get to that for probably six weeks,

449
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
because that's going to take a whole different set of tools to understand.

450
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So what I'd like to do for the first three or four weeks is to focus on time and just time,

451
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and then I'm going to bring in risk once we develop a little bit more machinery to understand how to capture risk.

452
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And when we put these two together, we're going to get modern finance.

453
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So that will happen some time in week six, seven, and eight.

454
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Now finally, I want to talk about the fundamental principles of finance, and then I'm going to talk specifically about this course.

455
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
There are six fundamental ideas that finance has come up

456
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
with that really will change the way you think about the world,

457
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and you won't appreciate it today. I know that. But I want to put it into your subconscious today,

458
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:49,000
because sometime over the next 13 weeks, at least I hope over the next 13 weeks, your face will light up

459
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and you're going to get it one day. You're going to get it in the sense that you will understand at that point in time

460
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
how these six principles can be used to make any financial decision that you need to make

461
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,000
for the rest of your careers. The first principle is pretty obvious. There is no such thing as a free lunch.

462
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Actually all of these principles are approximations to a much more complex truth.

463
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So if you really want to be strict about it, it should read, there may be free lunches on occasion,

464
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but there's no such thing as a free lunch program. There isn't systematic free lunches.

465
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You might be able to find one or two every now and then if you're lucky and if you work hard,

466
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
but systematic transfers of wealth for no reason at all

467
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
are unlikely. Second principle. Other things equal-- and this is a phrase

468
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that you'll hear economists utter all the time. And of course, other things are never equal, but let's pretend that they are.

469
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Other things equal, individuals satisfy three characteristics.

470
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They prefer more money to less. That's often called non-satiation.

471
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They prefer money now to money later, and they prefer less risk to more risk

472
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
when risk is defined properly. Now I'd argue that these principles

473
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
are in fact fairly universal. Not that you can't find exceptions every now and then

474
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
for every individual, but by and large over periods of time

475
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and over a large population this is generally true. And if you don't believe me or if you

476
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
know people that don't satisfy these principles, please introduce them to me after class.

477
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'd like to get to know them, and do some business with them.

478
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Principle three. All agents act to further their own self-interest.

479
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Now again, this is not to say that there aren't Mother Teresas out there.

480
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That there aren't people that care about the general welfare of the public. But economists in their own unique and annoying way

481
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:16,000
have been able to redefine preferences to even argue that Mother Teresa is incredibly selfish, because her utility

482
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
function is the function-- the utility function of other people. And so by doing all this good, Mother Teresa

483
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
was only furthering her own self-interests. Isn't she so selfish.

484
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Now, so in a way when the economist defines preferences, they almost define it as a tautology.

485
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But finance makes economics practical in the sense that I'll describe in a few weeks exactly

486
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
what kinds of preferences are actually embodied in decision making, and why this principle is more often than not,

487
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,000
a pretty good approximation to a much more complex reality. Now the last three principles I'm not

488
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
going to talk about in great detail, because those really embody a much larger set of issues

489
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,000
about economics and finance. We're going to talk about those three principles, but only in the last lecture oddly enough.

490
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We're going to use them. We're going to use these principles, but in the last lecture I'm going

491
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
to question all of the framework that I've developed for you, and show you where the holes are.

492
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
For the first 13 weeks, I'm going to need you to willingly suspend your disbelief as we describe

493
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
the relatively straightforward and standardized framework

494
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,000
for thinking about financial problems. And in the last lecture I'm going to describe to you where the approximations were made,

495
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and why you need to take advanced courses in finance to fill those gaps.

496
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So with that said, let me now turn to course overview, and then I'll take questions about course mechanics.

497
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
There are going to be four sections of the course as outlined in the syllabus. The four sections are the introductory material,

498
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
which we've gone over today. Section B, which we will cover for the next three or four

499
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
lectures is valuation. Discounting and the mathematics of net present value.

500
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Pricing stocks, bonds, futures, forwards, and options, and the relative kinds of issues that

501
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:34,000
come up across those different asset classes. Section C will focus on risk, and introduce risk

502
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
into the framework of section B. So once we complete Section C,

503
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,000
we will then have focused on time and risk. And finally section D will be how

504
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,000
to apply those principles to problems in corporate finance. What Jack Welch did from 1981 to 2001.

505
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
How do you take these ideas, and apply them to practical circumstances.

506
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And then the last lecture will be a lecture-- this is not the same last lecture as other last lectures.

507
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm not going to die, but so I don't mean to call it the final lecture. That sounds a little ominous.

508
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The idea behind this last lecture is to put it all together, and explain how these financial theories interact

509
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
with imperfections in the marketplace, and what is-- or is not good approximations.

510
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Let me talk about course requirements now.

511
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Obviously the lectures and the readings, and attendance and participation will be an important part

512
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
of the course. We are not going to cover the entire tome of Brealey, Myers

513
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and Allen. This is a book, which if dropped off of a six-story building could actually kill somebody if it hit them.

514
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So we can't possibly cover the entire textbook. We'll cover selected chapters, but this is Finance 401,

515
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
so it's an introductory course. And so the readings that you are going to be responsible for are the ones that are outlined on the reading list,

516
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and that I've listed in every lecture. So for example, chapters one and two, you are now responsible for.

517
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And we will be grading class participation. So I expect you to come to class prepared, and ready

518
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
to discuss material, and possibly questions that we may have raised in the previous lecture. And there will be one case study that you

519
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
will be responsible for writing up and handing in, and that will be worth 10% of the grade. And attendance and participation will be worth another 10%.

520
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
So that's 20% of your grade. And then finally the midterm and final exam

521
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
will be worth 25% and 55%. Let me explain a little bit about how

522
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
the midterm and final exam works, because it's a little different in this class than in some of the other classes. And by the way, this grading scheme

523
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and the particular mechanisms are identical in these two sections that I teach, and in the sections that Professor Wang teaches.

524
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So he and I have coordinated to have the same approach, so as not to advantage or disadvantage any one section.

525
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
In your readings packet will be a collection of problems

526
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:22,000
that we've put together. And actually I don't know if it's in there right now or if it's being photocopied, but we will prepare a list of problems that you can work on.

527
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:32,000
These are completely optional. And there are far too many problems for you to be able to do even in one full semester.

528
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The reason we give them to you is, because the only way to learn finance is to do finance.

529
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:48,000
If you come into the class and listen to my lectures you may be entertained for an hour and a half, you won't learn the material.

530
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,000
In fact, I've now changed the way I talk about the course, and I don't describe what I do as teaching anymore.

531
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Because teaching implies that I can force feed knowledge into your brains.

532
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It turns out it can't be done. And my two sons have proven that to me time and again.

533
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You have to want to learn the material, so you have to pull the knowledge from me into you.

534
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
In other words, you have to be an active participant. My 12th grade math teacher used to say that mathematics

535
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
is not a spectator sport. That's the same for finance. Finance is not a spectator sport.

536
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You actually have to do it. You have to confront yourself with problems time and again,

537
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
and think about how to apply the principles in our lecture to those problems.

538
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The purpose of a lecture is to give you the motivation, and take you through the most difficult aspects

539
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
of the principles and the theories of financial analysis. But it's your job to do the analysis.

540
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And to that end we're going to give you some motivation. And the motivation is that the midterm and the final exams

541
00:59:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
are structured so that most of the weight is placed on the final. The reason is the final is cumulative.

542
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So it's going to cover twice the material as the midterm. Therefore it should be worth roughly double.

543
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But the other reason is that financial analysis is alien to the typical human cognitive process.

544
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
None of you are hard wired to engage in net present value calculations.

545
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And so it's going to take some time before you get it, before it sinks in. And I've taught this class many times

546
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
before, and usually somewhere between week eight and week 13

547
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
a light goes off in your head, and you get it. And I see this by the bright smiles on your face around that time.

548
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It could be because you're getting to the end of the semester, and you're glad to be done with the class. But I like to think that it's because at some point

549
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you actually get it. In a few rare cases it happens at week 14, which is not so good, but hopefully

550
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
before the final exam. Now in order to provide you with extra incentive to do problems,

551
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and given this is an MBA class, I realize that all of you have very busy schedules, and you can schedule your own activities better than we can.

552
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So rather than have weekly problem sets that are due, and you have to hand them in, we have to hand them back. It's a hassle for everybody.

553
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are no problem sets in this class. None. However, we're going to give you a package of problems

554
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and solutions upfront. You'll get that within the next few days. And I will promise you that the majority of exam questions

555
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
will come verbatim from this package of problems. Majority.

556
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Meaning more than 50% of the points will come from the package.

557
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if all you did was to memorize this entire stack,

558
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you could ace the course. But of course, that would mean you would spend enormous amounts of time

559
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in finance, which is not such a bad outcome either. So we want to do this to eliminate

560
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a lot of the fear and anxiety with financial analysis. It is challenging, but it's a lot of fun too.

561
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We want you to have fun, because that's the only way you're going to learn this material well. So it's up to you as to how much you want to do.

562
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The recitations will cover selected problems. So you're not going to be left on your own. The recitations will go over problems and how to solve them.

563
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll do a few in class, the ones that are particularly challenging, but then you'll need to do more on your own.

564
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And if you do that, you will be prepared for the final exam better than most. The other material will be readings and lecture material,

565
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and therefore there will be some customization, because my lecture style is different from Professor Wang's.

566
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But the majority of the exam will be identical, and it will be drawn from these problem banks

567
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that you're going to get a copy of in advance. Now frankly, I have to tell you that I don't really

568
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
like to give grades at all, but I'm forced to do so. And so that's why we set up this process for assigning grades.

569
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In fact, a few years ago, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant way to assign grades, but I haven't been able to convince the dean's office

570
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to let me do that. And you know what it is? It goes like this. Let me show you.

571
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I propose to give everybody in this class a B. That's it.

572
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Everybody gets a B. Now before I do this, how many people would object to that?

573
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Raise your hand. All right, those of you with your hands up, you get As. Done.

574
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You see how brilliant that is?

575
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I get a grade distribution. No work. The only problem is it only works once.

576
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And when you're teaching two sections, so somehow the second section, it doesn't work as well. So I'm sorry I have to give grades.

577
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're all adults. I realize that. But nevertheless, this is a necessary part of the curriculum.

578
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So that's how we're going to be assigning grades. In the last four minutes, and I think

579
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to try to keep on time for the entire semester so we end at five before the half hour,

580
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and we start five after the hour. In the last four minutes, I want to tell you a little bit about how to get the most out of this course.

581
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we can take this up next time if you've got questions, but I want you to spend time thinking about this.

582
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Most of this course will be devoted to theory. But finance is not a theoretical subject

583
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
unlike algebraic topology. That's a theoretical subject. I've never heard anybody become a practical or applied

584
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
algebraic topologist. Finance on the other hand, there's no finance without practice.

585
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So while the course will be focused on the theory, I need you to think about the practical elements of it,

586
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and I'm going to help you in a couple of different ways. One is by problems, but the other is to encourage you to sit in on a pro-seminar called

587
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the Practice of Finance. This is a new pro-seminar that we're launching. September 17 is the first meeting.

588
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It doesn't carry any units, so you can come and go as you please. But it'll give you a sense of the practical aspects

589
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of the industry, and in particular information about the career aspects of the industry like what are starting salaries for financial analysts.

590
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or how do I get a job in finance if I don't have any background in it. It'll go through those kinds of issues. So I'd encourage you to keep that in mind.

591
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The second thing is with respect to the course, I will give you lecture notes ahead of time

592
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for all of the lectures. I expect you to take a look at them in advance. Just skim them. You don't have to read them, and try

593
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to sort out what I'm saying. But I want you to skim it at least. And then in class I urge you to take lots of notes,

594
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because the lecture notes are not meant to be complete. In fact, they are purposefully incomplete

595
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so that you have to use your hand and write down your impressions of the material as I'm speaking.

596
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because in that method, you will actually absorb more of the material, and it'll stay with you longer.

597
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I would urge you to review the lectures afterwards. Review what I said. Because you may have heard what I said, but you may not have understood what I said,

598
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and you may not be able to apply what I said. So you need to spend time afterwards soaking it in.

599
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I urge you to work on the assignments in groups, but also alone. Because when you do the midterm and final exams,

600
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you'll be doing them alone. So do both. Don't just assume that you can do the same in groups

601
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
what you will do alone. And finally, I would ask you to ask plenty of questions.

602
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to manage the class discussion. So that if we have time, I'd be happy to talk about issues that are current and on your mind.

603
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Even whether or not you should refinance your auto loan. We're happy to take those kind of questions assuming

604
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that it's apropos, and that we have the time to be able to cover that. I want you to get engaged.

605
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want you to take this course personally, because that's the only way you're going to really learn the material.

606
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
All right, thank you very much. We're out of time. We'll see you next Monday.
