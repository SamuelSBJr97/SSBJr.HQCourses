ANDREW W. LO: So on behalf of the Sloan School I want to welcome all of you to 15.401 Finance Theory.
0:34
This course is meant for first year MBA students.
0:40
And so that's the focus, and I'm going to assume that that's the background that all of you
0:46
will have. We may have a few other students in the class, but primarily it will be first year MBAs who
0:53
are thinking about a career in finance, as well as those of you who aren't
0:58
sure about a career in finance but are curious about it. Hopefully over the next 13 weeks we'll
1:05
be able to satisfy that curiosity. I want to start by talking a little bit
1:12
about what finance is, and how I got interested in it,
1:17
because I think it's often helpful in order to motivate a subject to get a sense of how
1:23
somebody else decided to choose this as a profession.
1:28
To do that I have to go back a little bit, and give you some background about
1:33
my own educational experiences. So let me start by mentioning that I've
1:42
been at MIT for the past 20 years, and been in the finance group all that time.
1:48
Before that I taught at the Wharton School for four years. And before that, I got my PhD in economics
1:53
from Harvard University, and then graduated in 1980 from Yale also majoring in economics.
2:02
And during that time I've learned an enormous amount both about finance and the real world,
2:09
but one of the things that I keep coming back to is the fact that the finance field
2:15
is almost unique in how it applies to practical management
2:20
problems. And what I want to try to do over the next 13 weeks is to convince you of the fact that finance
2:29
is in fact, the most important subject that you'll ever encounter. That in fact, finance is at the core of everything
2:37
that you will ever do in business and in management. Now that's a tall order I recognize,
2:44
and I suspect that some of you are quite skeptical about the role that finance might play in your own career objectives.
2:50
And I know many of you have very different career objectives. And I'm not even trying to convince all of you
2:55
to go into a career in finance, but I am trying to convince all of you that finance is really
3:01
the lifeblood and the basic lingua franca of all of business.
3:07
And that's one of the reasons why finance is such an important subject. Now before I begin, let me ask you a question.
3:14
How many people have had no finance background whatsoever?
3:20
Oh, that's great. I look forward to a challenge.
3:25
But the other reason it's great is I have to tell you that it's a real privilege for me to be here in front of you to tell you about finance
3:34
for the very first time. And it reminds me a little bit of my younger son who is an extraordinarily fussy eater,
3:41
he's eight years old now. But ever since he was born he had some allergies, and he just refused to eat most of everything.
3:47
In fact, my wife often says that my younger son is a vegetarian except he doesn't eat vegetables.
3:53
So he's an incredibly fussy eater, and somehow when he was one year old he saw my older son eating an ice cream cone,
4:00
and figured that that's something he ought to try. How he figured that out, I don't know. But he tasted it for the very first time,
4:08
and you could see his face change in about four seconds from disgust to curiosity to absolute, you know,
4:17
enthrallment with the taste and feel of ice cream. He just loved it thereafter. That's one of his major food groups now.
4:24
It's ice cream. And so I feel privileged to be able to share that experience
4:29
here in the sense that once you get a taste of finance, I think you're going to be incredibly excited and enthralled by the subject.
4:35
Because it's one of the few subjects, in fact, that's the only subject that I've encountered that is both rigorous, it's extraordinarily
4:43
challenging from a research and intellectual perspective, and at the end of the day it's extremely practical.
4:51
In fact, I would say it's indispensable for financial management. So I'm going to try to convince you of that over the next 13
4:57
weeks, and I'm going to do that by going over material that you will find indispensable.
5:04
As many of you know, at the end of the course we have a ritual where we hand out teaching ratings. And among the finance faculty, among all the faculty,
5:12
we're very concerned about good teaching. So these teaching ratings actually matter.
5:17
And I've always thought that having a teaching rating survey at the end of the semester,
5:23
is somewhat misguided. What I'd like to do, and what I've proposed hasn't been adopted yet, I propose
5:30
to have teaching ratings submitted five years after a course is done. Now this may be a problem for some people who aren't
5:39
up to speed in the classroom. But the reason I say this is, because it will only be after you get into your jobs, into your careers,
5:47
before you realize how useful finance is. And five years from now, I suspect all of you
5:54
will come back and say, gee, this is one of the most important courses you have ever taken. Not because of me, but because of the substance of what
6:01
we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks. It's because of you and all of the work that you will put into this course.
6:08
This will be the most challenging course you will ever love. So I-- stealing from the military--
6:14
I think that you'll really appreciate how the discipline of financial logic
6:20
will help you to think smarter about all of your management decisions no matter what you decide to do with your careers.
6:26
Now that's a very tall order. I've built up expectations. So I'm going to have to deliver over the next 13 weeks,
6:31
and we'll see whether or not we can do that. But let me start now by talking about what
6:37
we're going to cover today. I want to start with a little bit of motivation, and then talk about the dramatis personae.
6:44
These are the cast of characters that we're going to be focusing on over the next 13 weeks.
6:50
And then I'm going to lay out the fundamental challenges of financial analysis. It turns out there are only two.
6:58
There are only two challenges in financial analysis, and once you figure both of those out, you're done.
7:03
So if by chance you can figure that out before the end of the class, you don't need to come back for the rest of the lectures.
7:10
Then I'm going to turn to providing you with a framework for thinking about these financial
7:15
challenges. To me it's very important to have a framework to start with, because I like to organize my thoughts
7:21
into things that I know and things that I don't know. And of the things that I know, how did it relate to the stuff that I already knew, or thought I knew.
7:28
So I want to give you a sense of that kind of framework to think about financial analysis upfront.
7:34
You probably won't fully appreciate it at this point, but sometime over the next 13 weeks you will get it.
7:42
And so I want to give that to you so that you can start thinking about it subconsciously, unconsciously, and then eventually you
7:48
will understand how all the pieces fit together. I then want to talk about the importance
7:55
of two aspects of financial analysis that make finance different from every other discipline you
8:01
will ever encounter here at MIT and elsewhere. And that is time and risk.
8:08
Without those two factors it turns out that finance is actually done.
8:13
In other words, there's no real research challenges, no open questions left once you eliminate time and risk.
8:21
Put in another way, the only reason that there exists a finance department, and finance
8:27
faculty, and finance journals, and a finance industry, the only reason is because of time and risk.
8:34
So I'm going to come back to that. Then I'm going to conclude by giving you the six
8:40
basic principles of finance. These are principles that you will encounter in all of your finance courses for the rest of your stay
8:47
at MIT and elsewhere. These are the ideas, the fundamental ideas, that have shaped financial markets
8:53
and that are at the root cause of all of the financial market innovations, as well as all of the financial market crises
8:59
that we've seen including what's been going on over the last several months in the subprime mortgage market. In fact, we're going to talk about the subprime mortgage
9:06
problems after we cover fixed income securities. Right now I suspect most of you know that there's something going on, know that it's bad stuff,
9:14
but you don't know why, how, where, when, and what to do about it. Well, in about five lectures, you will.
9:21
It's not complicated, but it's different from anything that you've ever encountered. And in fact, financial analysis, I suspect,
9:28
is different from anything most of you have ever encountered. I'm hoping that by the end of the course,
9:34
it will change the way you think about everything. And again, I recognize that that's a tall order,
9:41
but you tell me 13 weeks from now whether or not I've delivered. And then I'll conclude by talking about the course
9:47
overview, and then finally I want to say a few words about how as a student you can get the most out of this course.
9:52
This is a part of the lecture that I've always felt is critical at the very start of a course
9:59
like this, because there are a number of challenges that you will face over the next 13
10:04
weeks regarding this material. And I've always thought that it would be helpful for the instructor to let me know where
10:12
those challenges might come from, and what I should do in advance to prepare for those challenges. So I'm going to do that at the end of this hour and a half.
10:20
For next time I'd like you to read Brealey and Myers, chapters one and two. We are going to be covering that today as well as next Monday.
10:30
So please keep up with your readings. And at the end of this lecture, I will talk a bit about the course requirements
10:37
and other aspects of the course mechanics. Any questions?
10:44
All right, let me start with some motivation about why you might want to study finance
10:50
and why finance is so important. And I've always found that with motivation it's really best
10:56
to do it in a personal way. That is, to try to find an individual or a group
11:01
of individuals that personify a particular discipline or endeavor.
11:06
And so there are three people that I'd like to introduce you to. I suspect you'll know at least two out of the three,
11:13
but my guess is you won't know all of them. The first person-- oh, before I do that, I want to introduce a very simple definition of what
11:21
finance is. So this is the very first equation that you'll ever see in this course, and there'll be many others of course.
11:27
But the first expression of exactly what is finance is this, finance is simply equal to mathematics plus money.
11:37
Now that suggests that mathematics as a discipline is equal to finance without the money, but really that's not my point.
11:46
Although it's true by the way, that's not my point. My point is that finance is the study,
11:52
the systematic and disciplined study of financial transactions of money.
11:58
Now when you see this you might think, well, gee, I don't really have a strong math background. Maybe I'm in the wrong place or the wrong class.
12:05
And I want to explain to you that that's completely inaccurate, and inappropriate.
12:14
When I say mathematics, I'm actually talking about a very wide range of mathematics.
12:20
Everything from the extraordinarily complex and profound to the extremely pedestrian
12:28
and obvious. So literally the range from differential geometry
12:34
and partial differential equations on one end of the spectrum to arithmetic and high school
12:40
algebra at the other end of the spectrum. Now since this is an introductory finance class,
12:46
I assume that you know nothing. What I mean by that is, I assume that there are no prerequisites that you have other than what it took
12:54
for you to get into here, which is pretty substantial by the way. Congratulations to all of you for getting in.
13:01
But we're not requiring that you have any background in quantitative analysis, computers,
13:09
upper level mathematics. So when I say finance is equal to mathematics plus money,
13:15
there's a variety of kinds of mathematics that can be appropriate for creating an extraordinarily profitable career in this industry.
13:23
And now here are the three examples. Anybody know who James Simons is?
13:30
Who is he? AUDIENCE: Well, I know about Renaissance. ANDREW W. LO: You know about Renaissance Technologies.
13:36
Do you know what James Simons did before he started Renaissance Technologies? Yeah.
13:41
AUDIENCE: He's a math professor. ANDREW W. LO: He's a math professor, that's right. James Simons is a math professor.
13:49
Well, was a math professor. In fact, he was quite a well-known math professor. When I first heard of him, it wasn't
13:56
because of Renaissance Technologies, which is a hedge fund that he started about 15 or 20 years ago.
14:03
James Simons was a differential geometer who for many years was the chairman of the math department
14:10
at Stony Brook in New York. And he authored with S.S. Chern a particular field of study
14:20
in differential geometry called Chern-Simons theory, which has subsequently proved to be extraordinarily
14:26
useful in an area of physics known as string theory. Extraordinarily abstract.
14:32
And Simon started a hedge fund about 20 years ago.
14:38
And this is probably the single most successful hedge fund in the history of the industry in terms of its performance
14:47
record. Over the course of 15 or 20 years,
14:52
he's put together a track record that has literally beaten every other hedge fund manager's track
14:58
record by a lot. So it's not just a little bit. He's just sort of way out there. He's the Michael Phelps of quantitative investment
15:06
strategies. By the way, just to give you a sense of how successful he has been.
15:13
In 2006, two years ago, it was reported by Institutional Investor's Alpha Magazine--
15:19
this is a trade publication for the hedge fund industry-- it was reported that James Simons was the single most highly
15:26
paid hedge fund manager that year with a take-home pay of $1.7 billion.
15:35
Now, that's not wealth, that's income. That was on his W-2.
15:42
That was one year's compensation. And he did it-- he did this by building a quantitative investment
15:50
management company with 75 PhDs in mathematics, physics, computer science, and so on.
15:57
And nobody, nobody knows what he does or how he does it. It's extraordinarily secret.
16:03
But there's no doubt that he's incredibly successful. So that's one end of the spectrum.
16:09
That kind of mathematics can make money, and can be extraordinarily relevant financial analysis.
16:16
Now at the other end of the spectrum, we have this guy.
16:22
You may have heard of him, Warren Buffett. He is currently the richest man on earth.
16:28
In 2008 Forbes ranked him number one in terms of wealth. At the time, February of 2008, he was worth $62 billion.
16:38
In fact, in a private conversation I was told that when Simons found out he said, really?
16:43
$62 billion? How did he get that? It's amazing. That's an extraordinary amount of wealth for an individual
16:50
to put together. And what's extraordinary about it, is how he did it. As many of you know Warren Buffett is an investor based
16:57
in Omaha, Nebraska. His office is probably smaller than many of the conference
17:06
rooms here at Sloan. The number of people he has working for him, I suspect, is fewer than many of you who have
17:12
done your startups or plan to. He's got an extraordinarily small staff.
17:17
Mainly it's Charlie Munger and him, and a couple of secretaries, and maybe a few accountants here and there, and lawyers of course.
17:27
But what he does is to read company prospectuses, income
17:33
statements, balance sheets. And with literally high school arithmetic
17:39
he's built this incredible investment empire by looking at valuation.
17:46
Simple accounting. Now I say simple accounting, but there's nothing simple about what he does.
17:52
And so clearly he has certain skills that also involve mathematics, but not
17:58
the kind of mathematics that James Simons uses. And finally, the third individual
18:04
that I'd like to introduce you to is this fellow, Jack Welch. Now again, many of you know him or know of him.
18:11
You know that he actually teaches a course here at Sloan. But you may not know that his PhD was actually
18:19
in engineering. And he started out at General Electric in 1960.
18:25
Became CEO in 1981, and at that time the revenues
18:32
of General Electric was about $26 billion a year. So it was already a big and successful company.
18:39
And Jack Welch took it over in 1981. At the time there were 400,000 employees for General Electric.
18:47
Five years later, there were 300,000 employees at General Electric. He eliminated 100,000 jobs.
18:53
That's one of the reasons why he developed the nickname Neutron Jack, because like a neutron bomb,
18:59
he eliminated a huge segment of the population. But five years later with 300,000 employees,
19:08
he increased the market value of General Electric by several fold. And at the end of his tenure in 2001, 20 years later,
19:17
General Electric's revenues was not $26 billion, it was $130 billion.
19:23
He increased it by a factor of 4 and 1/2 over the course of 20 years.
19:28
It's an extraordinary accomplishment for an individual. Now why do I put him up here?
19:35
It's because one of the things that Welch did at General Electric, one of the things that he was extraordinarily good at, was making
19:42
good decisions about investments, making good decisions about costs, being able to understand
19:49
the language of finance despite the fact that he used none of his PhD skills in his job.
19:56
He was an engineer by training, not a manager. He didn't go to management school,
20:02
although he did a lot of executive education after his PhD.
20:09
The reason that I give you these three cast of characters is because they are so different in what they do.
20:16
They have such different backgrounds. They're all extraordinarily successful,
20:21
but there's one thing in common. The thing in common is that they all understand innately,
20:28
deeply, fundamentally, the language of finance. And what we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks,
20:34
are the very basics. Things that they take for granted. Things that they use on a daily basis to do their jobs.
20:43
So it's not to say that if you do well in this course you'll end up being one of these guys,
20:48
but it's certainly a prerequisite I would say. There's nobody that's been successful in business,
20:54
truly successful, without having an understanding, at least an innate or instinctive understanding,
21:00
of the concepts that we're going to cover over the next 13 weeks. So to me, that's exciting.
21:06
Now again, I'm not trying to motivate you by greed. I'd rather motivate you by the intellectual challenge
21:12
of finance, and there will be some extraordinarily challenging ideas. Ideas that are not natural for any of you at this point,
21:21
but which I hope will be very natural at the end of this 13 weeks.
21:27
So let me start with the cast of characters that we're going to be studying over the next 13 weeks.
21:35
There are going to be four components of the economy that we're going to focus on. Now this is a flow diagram of the economy.
21:41
Since we're at MIT we have to have flow diagrams at some point, right? So here's my version of a flow diagram.
21:49
This is a flow model of the economy, and there are four components that comprise the financial system.
21:55
Households, financial intermediaries, non-financial corporations, and then capital markets.
22:04
Now obviously the economy is comprised of additional components like labor markets and product
22:09
markets. We're not going to focus on that. Although there are certain financial aspects of those markets.
22:15
Given that we only have 13 weeks, our attention will be spent on those four components,
22:21
and I'm going to cover each of those four components, both in parallel and to a certain degree sequentially,
22:27
all right? So I want you to be familiar with these four, because we're going to be talking about them interchangeably at various points in time.
22:35
Financial analysis applies to all of these components in exactly the same way.
22:40
But once you apply them to the specific context, the terminology may change, the particular applications
22:46
may look different. What I'm going to try to teach you in this 13 weeks is the underpinning theories that
22:52
unify all of the various different kinds of ideas. So these are the four components that we're
22:57
going to be looking at from now and then. Now let me talk about the fundamental challenges
23:03
of finance. I told you that there are only two, right? And here they are.
23:08
There are two aspects of financial analysis that we're going to be focused on. The first is the valuation of assets.
23:17
And the second is very simply the management of assets.
23:26
That's it. That's all there is to it. Valuing and managing.
23:33
And I can tell you exactly what the managing part is going to look like. Managing is going to involve figuring out which of two
23:40
possibilities is more valuable. And then you know what? You take the more valuable option.
23:47
That's it. That's all there is to it. Figuring out the value, that's going to be challenging.
23:55
So we're going to take that first challenge to start with, and try to understand valuation.
24:03
I'm going to argue that all business decisions, any kind of business decision, involves those two challenges.
24:10
Valuing something, and then once you value it, make a decision on what you want to do with that value.
24:20
This is why I've argued that finance is the most important subject, because literally any business decision that you will ever engage in,
24:26
constitutes those two components. Valuation and management.
24:31
Now valuation is going to be a challenge by itself, because it's not at all clear what value we're talking about.
24:40
In other words, what is value? Is water valuable?
24:46
Well, life can't be sustained without it. At least carbon based forms of life. So water is pretty valuable.
24:52
But water is not that expensive. At least before Poland Springs came along.
24:58
Now what about diamonds? As far as I know, humans do not need diamonds to survive, and yet diamonds are extraordinarily expensive.
25:06
There are certain gems that are invaluable. Now how can that be?
25:11
Clearly we have to think more carefully about what we mean by value.
25:17
And of course, once value is established then management is relatively easy to do.
25:24
Objectives plus valuations obviously leads to decisions. So once you tell me what you're trying to achieve,
25:31
and then you value all the various different possibilities, then I can tell you what the right decision is.
25:36
Pick the decision that is the most valuable for achieving the objectives that you want.
25:43
Now that doesn't really help a lot if we can't apply this to specific contexts,
25:49
and come up with specific value. So I want to hammer this home, and to do
25:54
that I want to talk about how it is that financial markets helps us establish value through the price discovery mechanism.
26:03
And to do that, I am going to do a simple demonstration. Now when I was growing up I went to one
26:09
of these specialized high schools that focused on science. So we were always getting these various different kinds
26:14
of neat demonstrations of the Tesla kind of coil. I've always been very jealous of these science teachers,
26:21
because they have these cool demonstrations that we in finance don't. So I've developed a little demonstration of my own.
26:28
It's a simple one that has to do with the price discovery mechanism, and because I teach two sections, I'm going to have to make it a little bit more
26:34
involved than normally. So I need two volunteers. The first volunteer-- thank you. I'd like you to take these two pieces of paper,
26:40
these are blank pieces of paper. On one of them write heads, and the other write tails. And then place them face down, and shuffle them
26:47
so you don't know which is which. And I need another volunteer who has a coin that they can flip,
26:54
because-- thank you. So as soon as he's done, I'm going to ask you to flip a coin. Do you have a coin by the way?
26:59
AUDIENCE: Yeah. ANDREW W. LO: OK. I have two items here. One of which is going to be auctioned off in this section,
27:07
and the other is going to be auctioned off in the later section. And since I don't know what your preferences are for one or the other, I want to randomize this
27:14
so that there's no chance that I favor one section or the other. So are you done with that?
27:19
You shuffled them. You don't know which is which. OK, I'd like you to take these two face down, and put one in front of one of these packages,
27:25
and the other in front of the other face down as well. While you do that, can you go ahead and flip your coin?
27:33
And as soon as he puts that on there, I want you to tell me whether you flipped heads or tails. And based upon that, the particular object
27:40
that is chosen will be auctioned off in this particular section. OK, go ahead.
27:45
What have you got? AUDIENCE: Tails. ANDREW W. LO: Tails, OK. So tails. This is heads, and this is tails.
27:53
So here is the item that I'm going to auction off. Before I do that, I'm going to ask somebody. Anybody know what's in here?
28:01
Nobody knows what's in that box? Well, what do you think its value is?
28:07
Zero?
28:12
Negative? Can't be negative, right? There's limited liabilities.
28:17
You can't owe me for something that's in there. So good. We've established some information.
28:22
There's a zero lower bound. Well, I don't know what the value is.
28:28
So what we're going to do is we're going to figure it out. Rather, you're going to figure it out.
28:35
I'm going to auction this off, and now this is for real. So don't bid if you can't pay me, and by the way,
28:44
I expect to be paid in cash. All right? So I'm serious.
28:50
This is a serious game. So if you don't want to participate, you're not prepared to pay me in cash at the end of this lecture, do not bid.
28:57
All right? OK, I'm going to open it up. Anybody want to start bidding for this item?
29:04
AUDIENCE: $1. ANDREW W. LO: $1. AUDIENCE: Three. ANDREW W. LO: $3. AUDIENCE: $4.
29:09
AUDIENCE: Four. AUDIENCE: Six. ANDREW W. LO: Six. AUDIENCE: Five. ANDREW W. LO: All right, $6 is the high bid.
29:15
Can't do that. All right, $6 is the high bid. AUDIENCE: Ten.
29:21
AUDIENCE: Ten. ANDREW W. LO: Ten. OK, we got two tens here. You were the first. So that's your bid. Your bid is the high bid. $10.
29:27
AUDIENCE: 20. ANDREW W. LO: 20. We have 20. Wow! AUDIENCE: High roller. ANDREW W. LO: $20.
29:33
You do see that this package is smaller than this one, right? It's a tiny little thing. $20.
29:38
AUDIENCE: 30. ANDREW W. LO: $30. $30.
29:43
High bid. Any more than $30? AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question, please?
29:48
ANDREW W. LO: Yes. AUDIENCE: Where does the money-- who gets it? ANDREW W. LO: I get the money. That's a great question.
29:53
That's a great question. This is going to go to the foundation to support Andrew Lo.
29:59
I'm the charity. So this is not a charity auction. This is going to go to me. By the way, I paid for these items.
30:06
So that's why it's going to go to reimburse my teaching costs. AUDIENCE: It's going to ice cream, [INAUDIBLE]
30:11
ANDREW W. LO: Right. OK, $30 high bid. Any higher bid than that?
30:18
$30? Nothing higher? AUDIENCE: 31. ANDREW W. LO: 31.
30:25
AUDIENCE: 35. ANDREW W. LO: 35. OK, do I hear 40?
30:32
Anybody want to do 40? $40?
30:37
AUDIENCE: I'll give you 40. ANDREW W. LO: $40. All right, we've got $40.
30:43
Anybody willing to go 45? $45?
30:51
All right. AUDIENCE: 45. ANDREW W. LO: $45. Wow! OK.
30:56
Do we hear 50? $50?
31:02
45 is the high bid. Anybody for 50? AUDIENCE: Can I short too? ANDREW W. LO: No shorting, sorry.
31:08
I'm the only auctioneer here. $45 is the high bid. Anybody here 50?
31:14
Going once. Going twice. All right, sold. $45.
31:20
Now you're going to pay me, right? AUDIENCE: Yep. ANDREW W. LO: All right. We established the value.
31:28
It's $45. That's the market at work.
31:33
None of you knew what was in here. It could be nothing actually.
31:40
But I suspect that you didn't think it was nothing,
31:45
because you bid for it, right? Moreover, I didn't let you touch it. I didn't let you feel it.
31:51
I didn't let you shake it. There was no information whatsoever other this very pretty packaging. And yet somehow magically you were
31:59
able to come up with a value. Now we could argue whether that value is good or bad.
32:04
But it's a number, and it's a number that can now be used for analysis.
32:10
Now again, I'm not commenting on how good or bad the number is. In a minute we're going to find out, because I'm going to open this.
32:15
Or let this gentleman here open it, and see what he bought. But before he does that, I want to comment that knowing nothing
32:24
without any information whatsoever, we've established value.
32:31
That's remarkable. Now it's not true, though, that there is no information. In fact, there's a tremendous amount
32:39
of information in this room. Tremendous amount. Because you know a number of things.
32:45
You know about the size of packages. You know about the fact that I'm a professor, and if I really cheat you then I might get in trouble
32:52
with the dean. There are a number of constraints that are in place,
32:58
and with this audience those constraints affected the value.
33:03
For the next five weeks that's what we're going to be doing, is talking about valuation and trying
33:09
to understand how what just happened happened.
33:15
OK, would you like to open it up, and let us know what you've got for your $45? And you'll let me know whether this
33:21
has been a good deal or a bad deal for you and for me.
33:30
Oh, just rip it. My wife does this all the time.
33:35
It drives me crazy. My sons are just-- AUDIENCE: I'm enjoying my [INAUDIBLE] $45.
33:42
ANDREW W. LO: Fair point. Fair point.
33:51
AUDIENCE: Oohhh! [APPLAUSE]
33:58
ANDREW W. LO: Anybody know what the retail value of that is? It's an iPod Nano 4 gig version.
34:05
AUDIENCE: 125. ANDREW W. LO: 149 to be precise. So you had a good deal.
34:11
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. ANDREW W. LO: You're welcome. Thank you, because what we did was
34:18
to engage in a price discovery process with limited information. With limited information.
34:23
I couldn't get the value out of that that I wanted to. I would have loved to have gotten a bid of $149,
34:31
but would any of you be willing to pay that for a box with no information at all?
34:37
Probably not. So the lack of transparency, the lack of information, actually reduced the value of that object.
34:44
But nevertheless, it did have a value. Because some of you were willing to take a chance that there might be something interesting in that package.
34:52
That is what we're going to try to understand over the next 13 weeks, and for the first five of those weeks
34:59
we're going to try to take it apart. We're going to try to understand how it is that the market comes
35:04
up with the value. And it's going to be a challenge.
35:09
This is hard to do, because just like if we decided to spend the rest of the lecture figuring out
35:14
how you came up with a $45 bid, or why you weren't willing to go to 50.
35:20
It's going to be really hard for us to tease out all of the thinking that went into this kind of discussion.
35:25
So that's why we have work to do. It will be exciting work, because at the end we are going to come up with specific quantitative analysis
35:35
that will tell us how valuation is done. So that's where we're going to focus on
35:41
for the next few weeks. Clearly once we figure out valuation,
35:48
we can then focus on management. And the first two-thirds of this class will be focused on valuation.
35:55
The last one third will be focused on taking those ideas, and applying them to management contexts like capital budgeting
36:04
and risk management. For valuation, the kind of questions
36:10
that we're going to tackle are ones that implicitly we did in just a few minutes here. It's going to be how are financial assets valued
36:19
versus how should they be valued, and is that always the same?
36:25
Is it the case that financial assets are valued the way they should be valued, and what do we even mean by whether or not it should
36:32
be valued in a way or not. And finally, we're going to ask the question for valuation,
36:38
how well do financial markets really work? Can we always rely on them to work well?
36:44
In this case, I don't know if you would call this particular auction one that worked out well.
36:50
Certainly worked out well for you, but it didn't work out well for me. So in what sense did it work out well?
36:58
Well, it worked out well in the sense that if I really wanted to get rid of that box, if I really wanted to unload it, I actually was able to do that.
37:06
And I got something for it. Sight unseen, with no information whatsoever, I actually got $45.
37:12
Roughly a third of the value of the asset. That's actually not too bad. If you're trying to sell an asset sight unseen,
37:20
and you need to do it immediately, a 66% discount is actually pretty fair.
37:27
Now we're going to see more examples of that over the next few weeks. Once we determine value, then the question is management.
37:35
How much should I save or spend? That's a management question that all of you have to deal with at some point or another in your lives.
37:42
What should I buy? What should I sell? When should I buy and sell it, and how should I finance the transaction?
37:47
Those are the problems of financial analysis plain and simple. These are problems that apply to Jack Welch, to James Simons,
37:55
to Warren Buffett, and to you. And it applies to you not just from the corporate perspective,
38:01
but from a personal perspective as well. Every one of you have to think about these issues on a daily basis.
38:07
And so finance really is completely inclusive in the sense that it applies to virtually everything
38:14
that you will ever encounter in life. To do that I have to go over the framework
38:20
of financial analysis, and the starting point is accounting.
38:25
Accounting is the language, the lexicon of finance
38:31
in that it's the beginning of how to measure economic concepts. Like profit and loss, revenues and costs, and so on.
38:41
So while many of you may not have accounting backgrounds, you will learn a fair bit of accounting in this course,
38:48
just because you're going to have to in order to understand the material in the lectures.
38:53
So you'll need to get familiar with the basic terms of accounting, and in particular you're going to have to focus on two concepts that are probably
39:01
alien to you. The notion of a stock and a flow. Now when I say stock, I don't mean common stock or equities,
39:09
I have a different term in mind. By stock in this context, I mean the stock of assets.
39:16
The level of assets. And by flow I mean the rate of change of assets.
39:24
You know when I was in grad school, we started discussing this concept on the first day of macroeconomics, and then one of the students
39:30
in the back of the room said, excuse me, Professor, but isn't that just the distinction between a variable
39:36
and its first derivative? And the professor was a little bit taken aback and said,
39:42
well, yes, that's right. But let me give you another way of thinking about it that is somewhat more intuitive. And that is, think about a bathtub,
39:48
and think about the faucet turned on and the water flowing into it. The stock is the level of the water.
39:56
The flow is how fast the water is coming into the tub.
40:01
And so after that explanation the student still seemed confused, and so the professor said,
40:07
you know what, some people find bathtubs intuitive, other people find derivatives intuitive. So to each his own.
40:14
These two concepts are extraordinarily critical to financial analysis. And accounting counterparts are nothing more than the balance
40:22
sheet and the income statement. The balance sheet measures the stock of wealth of a company.
40:29
What your assets are, and what your claims on those assets or liabilities are.
40:37
On the other hand, the flow of wealth into a company or out of a company is measured by the income statement.
40:45
This tells you how much the company is making per unit time versus its losses.
40:55
So the framework for financial analysis that we're going to be coming back to time and again is this framework of a corporation.
41:02
A corporation has a certain set of assets. It's got claims on those assets, which are called liabilities.
41:09
So this picture, this snapshot, measures the level of the bathtub. But that's not enough to understand
41:15
how a company is doing. You also have to look at the income statement, which
41:21
tells you the sources of funds, and the uses of funds over any time period.
41:26
Typically on a quarterly basis. So we're going to come back to this concept as the framework
41:33
for financial analysis. And by the way, this is the sum total of the tools
41:39
that Warren Buffett uses for analyzing his investments. That's it.
41:46
Believe it or not. Nothing fancier. So it's an incredibly powerful set of ideas
41:51
if you know how to read it.
41:57
That framework when you think about it from a corporate financial decision perspective,
42:02
involves making decisions at five points in time.
42:08
Corporate financial decisions involve thinking about how to deal with cash raised from investors.
42:16
How to think about cash invested in real assets, and how to deal with cash generated by operations.
42:24
How much cash to reinvest, and how much cash you give back to your investors.
42:31
So from this you should get the idea that as a corporate financial officer
42:36
you are focused on cash, the flow of cash. In fact, cash you can think of as the lifeblood of a company.
42:45
If you follow the cash, you will eventually hit upon every important aspect of the modern corporation's
42:51
operations. And as a financial officer, you will be responsible for analyzing that flow.
42:57
And as a decision maker, as a leader of a corporation, you're going to have to make decisions about that cash flow.
43:03
Jack Welch uses the information to be able to make those decisions. But he doesn't just get those decisions prepackaged for him,
43:10
he has to understand what those numbers mean. Just like Warren Buffett. Now the corporate financial decisions involved,
43:20
obviously, have a variety of different components from a perspective of career paths.
43:29
From the management perspective real investment decisions involve two and three.
43:35
So if you're thinking about investing in a new division or a new plant or getting involved in a new product area, you've
43:41
got to focus on two and three. On the other hand, if you're the chief financial officer, and you're thinking about how should the company finance
43:47
its operations, you're going to be focused on one and four. If you're the board of directors,
43:53
and you're deciding how much to pay out to the shareholders, you're going to be thinking about five.
43:58
And if you're engaged in managing the risks of the corporation, you're going to be worried about one and five.
44:03
And ultimately your objective as a shareholder and as a manager of this corporation
44:10
is to do well by the owners. So your objective is to maximize shareholder wealth,
44:16
and the framework that I've introduced is going to allow you to do that. Now again, this may seem kind of theoretical to you,
44:23
and I realize that. So I'm going to ask you to make this more personal. And to do that, I'm going to ask you to turn this
44:30
into your own personal household financial decision making framework. So I'd like you to take all of these ideas
44:36
and literally apply them to yourself. Think about the cash flows that are
44:42
flowing through your own life. There may not be that much right now since you're at school,
44:48
but believe me, it will grow. So the household, this is you, sits in
44:55
between real economic activities. In other words, your job, and financial assets
45:00
and liabilities, which are all of the financial transactions that you deal with.
45:06
So this cash flow process that I outlined for corporations, it
45:11
works for you too. So there's cash raised from financial institutions, right?
45:17
Like student loans or borrowing or home equity loans.
45:22
There's cash invested in real assets. What's the biggest real asset that you are all
45:27
investing in right now? AUDIENCE: Education [INAUDIBLE]. ANDREW W. LO: Exactly. Human capital, yourselves. Your own education.
45:35
Cash generated by labor supply. Well, obviously, when you get a job you're going to be generating cash.
45:40
Cash consumed and reinvested in real assets. So consumed means beer or pretzels or whatever,
45:47
and investing in real assets means you invested either in yourself or you invest it
45:53
in a home or your children. Those are real assets. Sometimes they're also real liabilities,
45:59
but that's a separate issue. And finally cash invested in financial assets.
46:05
Most of you may not have a lot of financial assets at this point, but you actually have some. I suspect 401(k) plans, retirement, Social Security.
46:13
Those are financial assets that whether you know it or not, you're invested in. And so when you think about management,
46:20
think about personal management. How are you managing yourself? You've got to think about real investment.
46:26
Consumption and financing, savings and investment, risk management, and, obviously, what is
46:32
your overall objective in life? And what you ought to be doing is with that objective in mind,
46:40
managing your real and financial assets to maximize the likelihood of achieving those objectives.
46:49
So what I'm asking you to do is, I want you to take this course personally. I want you to take the ideas.
46:56
Every single idea that I mention, and whether I tell you to or not for the next 13 weeks,
47:01
I want you to take that idea and ask the question, how does that make my life better off? How can I use that in my own personal management activities
47:11
to improve the kind of decisions that I'm making? Because if you could do that, if you learn how to do that instinctively,
47:17
you will then take those ideas and apply them to management contexts in your career. And it will make it much more likely
47:23
that you'll get more out of this course than you otherwise might. Now there are two other factors that I describe
47:29
that make financial analysis challenging, and those two factors are time and risk.
47:40
I've argued before that without these two elements finance is complete. There is no more research to be done.
47:47
There's no more analysis to be done, and all of you probably will already be able to intuit a lot of the decisions
47:55
that you're going to be forced to make. Because without time-- and by time I mean decisions
48:02
at different points in time-- without time and without risk financial decisions
48:10
actually reduce to basic micro economic analysis. If you've taken an undergraduate course in microeconomics
48:17
supply equal demand, well, you've learned all there is to learn about finance without time and risk.
48:24
The only reason that finance is interesting, the only challenging aspects of what we do
48:31
are because of time and risk. The fact that cash flows now are not the same as cash
48:39
flows later, and that time flows in only one direction.
48:44
In about four lectures, I'm going to give you an alternative proof of the theory of special relativity.
48:51
And this proof will have to do with the fact that interest rates are not negative.
48:57
It turns out that there's a very deep philosophical connection between finance and physics that we're going to get to.
49:03
But this is something that you don't need to be a physicist to understand. In fact, I'd argue that Warren Buffett,
49:08
although he may not be able to articulate these principles, these are principles that are somehow
49:15
inbred in his worldview. He knows that $1 today is not the same as $1 next year.
49:22
And he also knows that $1 today without risk is not the same as $1 today with a little bit of risk.
49:27
Even a tiny little bit of risk, he knows that. And at the end of this course, you will too.
49:35
So risk we have to talk about in a much more serious way. We're not going to get to that for probably six weeks,
49:41
because that's going to take a whole different set of tools to understand.
49:47
So what I'd like to do for the first three or four weeks is to focus on time and just time,
49:55
and then I'm going to bring in risk once we develop a little bit more machinery to understand how to capture risk.
50:02
And when we put these two together, we're going to get modern finance.
50:07
So that will happen some time in week six, seven, and eight.
50:13
Now finally, I want to talk about the fundamental principles of finance, and then I'm going to talk specifically about this course.
50:21
There are six fundamental ideas that finance has come up
50:27
with that really will change the way you think about the world,
50:32
and you won't appreciate it today. I know that. But I want to put it into your subconscious today,
50:40
because sometime over the next 13 weeks, at least I hope over the next 13 weeks, your face will light up
50:49
and you're going to get it one day. You're going to get it in the sense that you will understand at that point in time
50:54
how these six principles can be used to make any financial decision that you need to make
51:02
for the rest of your careers. The first principle is pretty obvious. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
51:09
Actually all of these principles are approximations to a much more complex truth.
51:14
So if you really want to be strict about it, it should read, there may be free lunches on occasion,
51:20
but there's no such thing as a free lunch program. There isn't systematic free lunches.
51:28
You might be able to find one or two every now and then if you're lucky and if you work hard,
51:33
but systematic transfers of wealth for no reason at all
51:38
are unlikely. Second principle. Other things equal-- and this is a phrase
51:44
that you'll hear economists utter all the time. And of course, other things are never equal, but let's pretend that they are.
51:52
Other things equal, individuals satisfy three characteristics.
51:58
They prefer more money to less. That's often called non-satiation.
52:05
They prefer money now to money later, and they prefer less risk to more risk
52:12
when risk is defined properly. Now I'd argue that these principles
52:18
are in fact fairly universal. Not that you can't find exceptions every now and then
52:24
for every individual, but by and large over periods of time
52:29
and over a large population this is generally true. And if you don't believe me or if you
52:35
know people that don't satisfy these principles, please introduce them to me after class.
52:41
I'd like to get to know them, and do some business with them.
52:48
Principle three. All agents act to further their own self-interest.
52:54
Now again, this is not to say that there aren't Mother Teresas out there.
52:59
That there aren't people that care about the general welfare of the public. But economists in their own unique and annoying way
53:07
have been able to redefine preferences to even argue that Mother Teresa is incredibly selfish, because her utility
53:16
function is the function-- the utility function of other people. And so by doing all this good, Mother Teresa
53:23
was only furthering her own self-interests. Isn't she so selfish.
53:28
Now, so in a way when the economist defines preferences, they almost define it as a tautology.
53:36
But finance makes economics practical in the sense that I'll describe in a few weeks exactly
53:44
what kinds of preferences are actually embodied in decision making, and why this principle is more often than not,
53:52
a pretty good approximation to a much more complex reality. Now the last three principles I'm not
54:00
going to talk about in great detail, because those really embody a much larger set of issues
54:06
about economics and finance. We're going to talk about those three principles, but only in the last lecture oddly enough.
54:14
We're going to use them. We're going to use these principles, but in the last lecture I'm going
54:20
to question all of the framework that I've developed for you, and show you where the holes are.
54:26
For the first 13 weeks, I'm going to need you to willingly suspend your disbelief as we describe
54:32
the relatively straightforward and standardized framework
54:39
for thinking about financial problems. And in the last lecture I'm going to describe to you where the approximations were made,
54:46
and why you need to take advanced courses in finance to fill those gaps.
54:53
So with that said, let me now turn to course overview, and then I'll take questions about course mechanics.
55:00
There are going to be four sections of the course as outlined in the syllabus. The four sections are the introductory material,
55:07
which we've gone over today. Section B, which we will cover for the next three or four
55:14
lectures is valuation. Discounting and the mathematics of net present value.
55:19
Pricing stocks, bonds, futures, forwards, and options, and the relative kinds of issues that
55:25
come up across those different asset classes. Section C will focus on risk, and introduce risk
55:34
into the framework of section B. So once we complete Section C,
55:40
we will then have focused on time and risk. And finally section D will be how
55:47
to apply those principles to problems in corporate finance. What Jack Welch did from 1981 to 2001.
55:57
How do you take these ideas, and apply them to practical circumstances.
56:02
And then the last lecture will be a lecture-- this is not the same last lecture as other last lectures.
56:08
I'm not going to die, but so I don't mean to call it the final lecture. That sounds a little ominous.
56:14
The idea behind this last lecture is to put it all together, and explain how these financial theories interact
56:21
with imperfections in the marketplace, and what is-- or is not good approximations.
56:27
Let me talk about course requirements now.
56:32
Obviously the lectures and the readings, and attendance and participation will be an important part
56:39
of the course. We are not going to cover the entire tome of Brealey, Myers
56:44
and Allen. This is a book, which if dropped off of a six-story building could actually kill somebody if it hit them.
56:51
So we can't possibly cover the entire textbook. We'll cover selected chapters, but this is Finance 401,
56:58
so it's an introductory course. And so the readings that you are going to be responsible for are the ones that are outlined on the reading list,
57:04
and that I've listed in every lecture. So for example, chapters one and two, you are now responsible for.
57:11
And we will be grading class participation. So I expect you to come to class prepared, and ready
57:17
to discuss material, and possibly questions that we may have raised in the previous lecture. And there will be one case study that you
57:24
will be responsible for writing up and handing in, and that will be worth 10% of the grade. And attendance and participation will be worth another 10%.
57:32
So that's 20% of your grade. And then finally the midterm and final exam
57:39
will be worth 25% and 55%. Let me explain a little bit about how
57:44
the midterm and final exam works, because it's a little different in this class than in some of the other classes. And by the way, this grading scheme
57:51
and the particular mechanisms are identical in these two sections that I teach, and in the sections that Professor Wang teaches.
57:58
So he and I have coordinated to have the same approach, so as not to advantage or disadvantage any one section.
58:06
In your readings packet will be a collection of problems
58:12
that we've put together. And actually I don't know if it's in there right now or if it's being photocopied, but we will prepare a list of problems that you can work on.
58:22
These are completely optional. And there are far too many problems for you to be able to do even in one full semester.
58:32
The reason we give them to you is, because the only way to learn finance is to do finance.
58:39
If you come into the class and listen to my lectures you may be entertained for an hour and a half, you won't learn the material.
58:48
In fact, I've now changed the way I talk about the course, and I don't describe what I do as teaching anymore.
58:56
Because teaching implies that I can force feed knowledge into your brains.
59:02
It turns out it can't be done. And my two sons have proven that to me time and again.
59:08
You have to want to learn the material, so you have to pull the knowledge from me into you.
59:14
In other words, you have to be an active participant. My 12th grade math teacher used to say that mathematics
59:20
is not a spectator sport. That's the same for finance. Finance is not a spectator sport.
59:25
You actually have to do it. You have to confront yourself with problems time and again,
59:31
and think about how to apply the principles in our lecture to those problems.
59:36
The purpose of a lecture is to give you the motivation, and take you through the most difficult aspects
59:43
of the principles and the theories of financial analysis. But it's your job to do the analysis.
59:50
And to that end we're going to give you some motivation. And the motivation is that the midterm and the final exams
59:56
are structured so that most of the weight is placed on the final. The reason is the final is cumulative.
1:00:01
So it's going to cover twice the material as the midterm. Therefore it should be worth roughly double.
1:00:08
But the other reason is that financial analysis is alien to the typical human cognitive process.
1:00:17
None of you are hard wired to engage in net present value calculations.
1:00:22
And so it's going to take some time before you get it, before it sinks in. And I've taught this class many times
1:00:29
before, and usually somewhere between week eight and week 13
1:00:34
a light goes off in your head, and you get it. And I see this by the bright smiles on your face around that time.
1:00:41
It could be because you're getting to the end of the semester, and you're glad to be done with the class. But I like to think that it's because at some point
1:00:46
you actually get it. In a few rare cases it happens at week 14, which is not so good, but hopefully
1:00:53
before the final exam. Now in order to provide you with extra incentive to do problems,
1:00:59
and given this is an MBA class, I realize that all of you have very busy schedules, and you can schedule your own activities better than we can.
1:01:07
So rather than have weekly problem sets that are due, and you have to hand them in, we have to hand them back. It's a hassle for everybody.
1:01:14
There are no problem sets in this class. None. However, we're going to give you a package of problems
1:01:20
and solutions upfront. You'll get that within the next few days. And I will promise you that the majority of exam questions
1:01:31
will come verbatim from this package of problems. Majority.
1:01:37
Meaning more than 50% of the points will come from the package.
1:01:42
So if all you did was to memorize this entire stack,
1:01:47
you could ace the course. But of course, that would mean you would spend enormous amounts of time
1:01:53
in finance, which is not such a bad outcome either. So we want to do this to eliminate
1:01:59
a lot of the fear and anxiety with financial analysis. It is challenging, but it's a lot of fun too.
1:02:05
We want you to have fun, because that's the only way you're going to learn this material well. So it's up to you as to how much you want to do.
1:02:13
The recitations will cover selected problems. So you're not going to be left on your own. The recitations will go over problems and how to solve them.
1:02:21
I'll do a few in class, the ones that are particularly challenging, but then you'll need to do more on your own.
1:02:26
And if you do that, you will be prepared for the final exam better than most. The other material will be readings and lecture material,
1:02:35
and therefore there will be some customization, because my lecture style is different from Professor Wang's.
1:02:41
But the majority of the exam will be identical, and it will be drawn from these problem banks
1:02:48
that you're going to get a copy of in advance. Now frankly, I have to tell you that I don't really
1:02:53
like to give grades at all, but I'm forced to do so. And so that's why we set up this process for assigning grades.
1:03:01
In fact, a few years ago, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant way to assign grades, but I haven't been able to convince the dean's office
1:03:08
to let me do that. And you know what it is? It goes like this. Let me show you.
1:03:13
I propose to give everybody in this class a B. That's it.
1:03:21
Everybody gets a B. Now before I do this, how many people would object to that?
1:03:27
Raise your hand. All right, those of you with your hands up, you get As. Done.
1:03:33
You see how brilliant that is?
1:03:39
I get a grade distribution. No work. The only problem is it only works once.
1:03:46
And when you're teaching two sections, so somehow the second section, it doesn't work as well. So I'm sorry I have to give grades.
1:03:53
You're all adults. I realize that. But nevertheless, this is a necessary part of the curriculum.
1:03:58
So that's how we're going to be assigning grades. In the last four minutes, and I think
1:04:05
I'm going to try to keep on time for the entire semester so we end at five before the half hour,
1:04:11
and we start five after the hour. In the last four minutes, I want to tell you a little bit about how to get the most out of this course.
1:04:19
And we can take this up next time if you've got questions, but I want you to spend time thinking about this.
1:04:25
Most of this course will be devoted to theory. But finance is not a theoretical subject
1:04:31
unlike algebraic topology. That's a theoretical subject. I've never heard anybody become a practical or applied
1:04:39
algebraic topologist. Finance on the other hand, there's no finance without practice.
1:04:46
So while the course will be focused on the theory, I need you to think about the practical elements of it,
1:04:52
and I'm going to help you in a couple of different ways. One is by problems, but the other is to encourage you to sit in on a pro-seminar called
1:05:00
the Practice of Finance. This is a new pro-seminar that we're launching. September 17 is the first meeting.
1:05:07
It doesn't carry any units, so you can come and go as you please. But it'll give you a sense of the practical aspects
1:05:12
of the industry, and in particular information about the career aspects of the industry like what are starting salaries for financial analysts.
1:05:20
Or how do I get a job in finance if I don't have any background in it. It'll go through those kinds of issues. So I'd encourage you to keep that in mind.
1:05:28
The second thing is with respect to the course, I will give you lecture notes ahead of time
1:05:34
for all of the lectures. I expect you to take a look at them in advance. Just skim them. You don't have to read them, and try
1:05:41
to sort out what I'm saying. But I want you to skim it at least. And then in class I urge you to take lots of notes,
1:05:47
because the lecture notes are not meant to be complete. In fact, they are purposefully incomplete
1:05:54
so that you have to use your hand and write down your impressions of the material as I'm speaking.
1:05:59
Because in that method, you will actually absorb more of the material, and it'll stay with you longer.
1:06:07
I would urge you to review the lectures afterwards. Review what I said. Because you may have heard what I said, but you may not have understood what I said,
1:06:14
and you may not be able to apply what I said. So you need to spend time afterwards soaking it in.
1:06:21
I urge you to work on the assignments in groups, but also alone. Because when you do the midterm and final exams,
1:06:26
you'll be doing them alone. So do both. Don't just assume that you can do the same in groups
1:06:33
what you will do alone. And finally, I would ask you to ask plenty of questions.
1:06:38
I'm going to manage the class discussion. So that if we have time, I'd be happy to talk about issues that are current and on your mind.
1:06:46
Even whether or not you should refinance your auto loan. We're happy to take those kind of questions assuming
1:06:52
that it's apropos, and that we have the time to be able to cover that. I want you to get engaged.
1:06:57
I want you to take this course personally, because that's the only way you're going to really learn the material.
1:07:03
All right, thank you very much. We're out of time. We'll see you next Monday.
